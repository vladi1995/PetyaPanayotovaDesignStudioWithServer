## About The Project

The project is designed as a platform for a Design Studio regarding cards for different occasions. User can login/register and then he/she can upload, modify or edit cards in 5 categories. They can also write comments, buy and like other cards.

This project was created by [Vladislav Dimitrov](https://github.com/vladi1995) for the purposes of React. js Softuni Course, February-March 2023. It is a full-stack application as both client and server part are written by me.
